## 🍧🍨🍩 Grid Search 🍩🍨🍧
Grid search allows us to test several parameters at once on a model. For example, we can test several numbers of clusters for a K-Means model and see how the K-Means model performs against different K values. To better understand grid search, we will try grid search using SKLearn.

## 🍧🍨🍩 Prepare Dataset 🍩🍨🍧
First, download the file "Salary_Data.csv"
```
import pandas as pd
``` 

## 🍧🍨🍩 Reading Dataset 🍩🍨🍧
Turn it into a dataframe
```
data = pd.read_csv('Salary_Data.csv')
```

## 🍧🍨🍩 Separating Attributes and Labels 🍩🍨🍧
Then separate the attributes and labels in the dataset. Do you still remember that if there is only 1 attribute in the dataset, we need to change its shape so that it can be used in model training.
```
import numpy as np
X = data['YearsExperience']
Y = data['Salary']
```

## 🍧🍨🍩 Changing Attributes 🍩🍨🍧
Change the shape of the attribute
```
X = np.array(X)
X = X.reshape(-1,1)
```

## 🍧🍨🍩 GridSearch 🍩🍨🍧
Next, to use grid search, we import the GridSearchCV library from sklearn.model_selection. Then we create the model that we want to test with grid search, in this case the SVR model. Then we create a python dictionary containing the names of the parameters to be tested, as well as their values. Next, we create a grid search object and fill in the parameters. The first parameter is the model we will test. The second parameter is a dictionary which contains a collection of parameters from the model to be tested. Finally, we call the fit() function on the grid search object that has been created.
```
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.svm import SVR
```
 
## 🍧🍨🍩 Model Parameters 🍩🍨🍧
Build a model with C, gamma, and kernel parameters
model = SVR()
```
parameters = {'kernel': ['rbf'], 'C': [1000, 10000, 100000], 'gamma': [0.5, 0.05,0.005]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, parameters)
```
 
## 🍧🍨🍩 Function Input 🍩🍨🍧
Training a model with a fit function
```
grid_search.fit(X,y)
```

## 🍧🍨🍩 Calling Attributes 🍩🍨🍧
After grid search looks for the best parameters in the model, we can display the best parameters by calling attributes
```
best_params_ of the grid search object.
```

## 🍧🍨🍩 Displays Parameters 🍩🍨🍧
Returns the best parameters of the grid_search object
```
print(grid_search.best_params_)
```

## 🍧🍨🍩 New model 🍩🍨🍧
Next, you can try to create a new SVM model with the grid search results parameters and train it on the data.
Create a new SVM model with the best parameters from the grid search results
```
new_model = SVR(C=100000, gamma=0.005, kernel='rbf')
new_model.fit(X,y)
```

## 🍧🍨🍩 Grid Search Visualization 🍩🍨🍧
Finally, we can visualize the SVR with the grid search results parameters. It can be seen from the plot results that the grid search succeeded in finding better parameters thereby improving the performance of the model.
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, new_model.predict(X))
```

Grid search will save a lot of time in finding the best parameters of the machine learning model.
